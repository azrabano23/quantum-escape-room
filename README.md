## 🔬 Quantum Concepts Explained

### Superposition
In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. The game demonstrates this through doors that are both open and closed until observed.

### Entanglement
When particles become entangled, measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

### Quantum Interference
Quantum particles can interfere with themselves, creating patterns where some outcomes become more or less likely based on wave interactions.

### Quantum Tunneling
Particles can pass through energy barriers that classical physics says should be impossible to cross. The probability depends on barrier height and width.

### Decoherence
Quantum effects disappear when systems interact with their environment. This explains why we don't see quantum effects in everyday life.
